- Please prefix all non-rustdoc comments with your GitHub username.

  Examples:

  ```rust
  /// This is a rustdoc comment, so no username is required.
  fn foo() {}

  // smoelius: This is a non-rustdoc comment.
  fn bar() {}
  ```

  ```sh
  #! /bin/bash
  # smoelius: This is a Bash comment, and therefore non-rustdoc.
  ```
